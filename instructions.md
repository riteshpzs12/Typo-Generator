## Typo Generator

A simple tool to generate typos of a word (password).  The code takes
an input of the path to the keyboard layout.  It is now done for the
normal laptop keyboard, however, the code will work for any layout.
First, you need to create a keyboard layout, and store it in a text
file.  Sample layout is given in [`qwerty.txt`](./qwerty.txt) as
english US laptop keyboard.  This file is required to run the code.

The code also takes a word from stdin and then generate the typos of it.

## Files of this Project  

* `Build.java`, `Generator.java` ->  Main code files, Build.java is the first file to be compiled
* `qwerty.txt`-> US English normal keyboard layout Sample with shift and unshift layouts.
* `before_1.txt`, `before_2.txt`, `finalout.txt`-> This code builds a character array of probable typos for a given keyboard layout. before_1 and before_2 are the pattern generated from qwerty.txt for without shift and with shift respectively. finalout is the final pattern after merging those two.
* `first_test_case.txt` -> This is the first test case i tried after the code writing was done......HA HA HA


## How to compile
```bash
$ javac Build.java
```
for eclipse just put these two files in the same package and run build.java first.
## How to run  
```bash
$ java Build qwerty.txt
ANUSHA
```
First input absolute filepath to the layout file and 2nd input is a string.
It takes a seconary input of a String and generates all posible typos of it that
are at one [edit-distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance) from it.

## Main Instruction
1. Download the whole `typo_generator/` folder in your machine.
2. Compile `Build.java`
3. Run `Build.class` with the first input you have to give is the absolute file path for the downloaded file.
4. It generates the pattern with this input with the help of generator object.
5. Give the password for which you want to know the typos as the second input.
6. The output will come in a list format for all one letter typos for all indexes.
7. No more answer is in front of You. Judge it brother.
